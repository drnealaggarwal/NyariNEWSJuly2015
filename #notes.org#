The workflow I use for Nyari News is to set up all the text in an EMACS org file from which I then cut and paste into the layout. If you are in here helping me with the writing and have cloned my github repository then please edit this file and push to the repo as you work so I can see what you are doing. As a team develops I hope that we'll have others working on other areas and will not duplicate our efforts while still have GIT track all our changes. Thanks for your help. Here are the topic areas that we work on for each newsletter. Edit each section as needed.

* Intro page
** notes about the AGM
- we need the new committee members
- number who attended

The Nyari AGM was the huge success that it always has been year after year. Fully and carefully created, audited and presented accounts were discussed at the meeting and explained to the members in attendance. Nyari's finances are in fairly good shape and should see us through another year if ALL members pay their dues on time. We thank the many members who have paid up the entire year in advance and those members who have contributed extra in cash and kind to support us through all our projects that we've carried out this year to better our estates and lives.

We had a small turnout which is disappointing considering that we have more than 230 households in Nyari now. Most of the committee was unanimously voted back in to another year of service. Some members left while some 'new' blood has joined us and we look forward to working with them. We extend a warm welcome to all new and old members; come see how we run Nyari!

* Finance
- projects we are going to undertake this fiscal year

The perennial problem persists. A very small percentage of Nyari members don’t pay citing their inability to afford the dues but the great majority do pay and do keep their payments current. However even among those that due pay there are huge delays while a very small minority pay up for an entire year in advance

*** what other Environmental issue could we raise for NRWS time time around?
*** write-up on Augur Buzzards for this issue

- One of the iconic sounds of Nyari is the Augur Buzzard. We have 3 pairs regularly visiting Nyari. Oftentimes they can be seen hovering over the open fields and plots holding almost statinary in the air looking down for prey. They consume a lot of field mice and keep our estate free from these pests.
- Pairs have noisy aerial displays, including outside the breeding season. The large (up to 1 m wide) stick nest is built in a tree or on a crag, and is often reused and enlarged in subsequent seasons. On the lake wall on Dr and Mrs Aggarwal's plot there is a nest that has now been used three times the Augurs raising five chicks to date. The first pair arrived in 1998 and they've been soaring over the estate all these years. Two creamy or bluish white eggs are laid and incubated by the female only, although food is brought to her on the nest by the male. The eggs hatch in about 40 days, and after a further 56–60 days they can attempt flight. At 70 days they become independent of the nest, but young birds may then be seen with the adult pair for some time. The diet of the Augur buzzard is mainly small ground mammals, but snakes, lizards, small ground birds, insects, and road-kill are also taken. Typically, the raptor drops on its prey from a perch or hover. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augur_buzzard

Another idea is to talk about the toad menace relating it to the cane toad and the dangers of introduction of alien species. You can mention hyacinth that was talked about in the Jan 2015 issue of NyariNews.


Above is the situation in California. A quick search on the internet can only bring tears. Global warming is real folks. We're losing the planet and if we don't do something about it soon -- we're going to lose it a

The amounts that we receive in advance help us keep Nyari running but closer inspection reveals that we're actually on a very tight string and must keep chasing members if we're to survive WHILE holding down the subscription rates. 

Think about this:

A few members have paid up for the entire year. That has given us a bunch of cash that makes it look like we're cash-rich. Keep in mind that what we have set as the subscription charge is almost par with what we need to keep running month-to-month; we're not trying to make a profit from our members. From those funds we pay the wages, maintenance bills, clean the environment and so on. Now let's get back to running from the sums that we've collected from generous members who've paid their dues upfront and well in advance. As we approach the latter parts of any year we 'know' we're going to run out of money and are not going to see too much in additional inflows as those that were going to pay up early have already done so and the rest have enjoyed the privileges the estate provides as a result of riding on those early-paying shoulders. So as the year wears on we find ourselves slowly beginning to panick. This is why you find Karanja and members of the various committees coming round to your homes asking that you pay up as much as you can as soon as you can. Folks this is burdensome indeed and that a few are being asked to repeatedly do this so that we can keep subs low is not fair on them. Do a little research of your own and you'll find that other estates are charging far more than Nyari just to stay afloat. Were we to raise the subs to double what it is today we'd also be able to take it a little easy and not ask you to pay on time or indeed to pay up as much as you can in advance.

Do you want to pay double the current subscription rate? We're sure you don't want to. So, please pay up NOW. Pay as much as you can, ideally for the remainder of this fiscal year so that you don't have to worry about Nyari subs until the end of April next year.


* Maintenance
- Neal still has the pics of the repair to the gate rail under barrier 3 that Manraj Matharu supplied. Perhaps an article on this could be produced if nothing comes through from members.
* ICT
- how about a write-up about on-line ed?
* Staff profile
- Karanja please suggest another staff member to profile and do what you did lasdt time getting me photos and a short bit of text. This time though just dump the photos into the repo (here) and I'll pull them myself.
* Member profile
- this was a flop last time. Perhaps we get rid of it altogether from future newsletters.
* Advertising
- confirm payment from Taipan Forex has been received.
* various filler pages like
** Gallery
 - don't have any more gallery photos in my possession. If you have any please dump them in here - in a directory of your own please, and I'll see what you've posted.
** Suggestions welcome
