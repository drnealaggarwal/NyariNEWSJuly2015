This is the repository for the next Nyari Newsletter - July 2015. If you are in here collaborating with me on this please clone the repository in the usual manner and push your changes to it as you work on the documents. Thank you for your help.

The notes.org file contains the text outline for the next newsletter. Those notes will be put into the layout. Please edit the notes.org file and add your contributions there. If you are not able to edit the org file then just create a PLAIN TEXT file using Notepad, TextEdit or Gedit (or if you know how then Vim or EMACS or other editor of your choice) and add that file to your own repository and push the changes to github.

If you have images that might be of use in the next edition of the newsletter please dump those into your directory on your local machine and push the changes to this repo.

EMACS is our tool for text editing, Adobe Indesign is used for layout.
